          A web app with a management control area for a local gym. The app not only
          listed available services and classes but also allowed trainers to customize
          the variety of classes scheduled throughout the month. Additionally, it
          enabled them to monitor which users signed up for each class.

          Developed several product catalog-style websites for a construction company, a
          furniture business, an electrical appliance company, and a few others. While

            developing strategies for high-pressure matches, and mentoring a group of
            five to six teenagers. It was a fast-paced environment, and keeping everyone
